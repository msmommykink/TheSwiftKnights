# The Swift Knights

**The Swift Knights** is a Minecraft RPG data pack that is based on the 10 Taylor Swift eras. Players progress and unlock the knights by playing and completing quests. When the player reaches the Midnights knight, which is currently the most powerful knight, they are able to rebirth and start over as a (Taylor's Version) knight.

Each knight has 5 abilities:
- Primary Attack
- Secondary Attack
- Primary Defense
- Secondary Defense
- Ultimate

All abilities are a mix of Melee and Ranged abilities. Melee abilities require the user to attack their enemy, turning their wand into a powerful weapon. Ranged abilities allow the user to sit back and allow the spell to do its magic.

To upgrade, players must craft the "Era Amulet", which will automatically unlock the next knight when right clicked if they have the correct items in their inventory. To switch knights, players can craft the "Era Bracelet", which is a one-time use chest that allows players to switch to their preferred knight. This bracelet is given for free when players craft the Era Amulet.

**None of this is final and is just here for me to jot down some notes, but also for you to suggest if you happen to have any suggestions. An outdated version of this data pack is available on Planet Minecraft**

**Current Goals:**
- Make the pack as malleable as possible
 - Any future changes should be relatively easy to add, especially when adding a new knight when Taylor releases future albums.
- Make the pack as efficient as possible
- Make the pack as multiplayer-friendly as possible
- Make the pack as fun, grind-worthy, and enjoyable to play.

Taking suggestions on Discord!
