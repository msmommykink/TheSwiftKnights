### THE BASICS
**The Swift Knights** is a Minecraft RPG datapack that takes inspiration from BG3 and basic DND campaigns. There are 11 knights based on the 11 eras. Each knight will have 3 types of abilities: attack, defense, and ultimate. Each ability will have a subtype: cantrip or spell. Cantrips can be cast at will. Spells can only be cast if the player has the correct scroll in their inventory. There are only 2 cantrip spells for attack and defense types. Ultimate ability is a spell and requires its according scroll. Players cannot pick up other knights' scrolls.
