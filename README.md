### THE BASICS
**The Swift Knights** is a Minecraft RPG datapack based on Taylor Swift and her Eras, that takes inspiration from BG3 and basic DND campaigns. There are 11 knights based on the 11 eras. Each knight has unique abilities (called Melodies) of the following types: Riffs (attack), Shields (defense), Traits (passive), Anthems (ultimate), and Tricks (utility). The attack & defense ability types are split into two: **Charms (cantrip)** and **Echoes (spell)** abilities. 

**Charms** - These abilities can be cast at will at the cost of Melodies (mana).
**Songs** - These abilities require their respective Lyrics (scrolls) to be cast and will still cost Melodies.
